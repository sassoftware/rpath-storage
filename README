This is a component of the rpath_common set of modules.  It provides
a stable interface for reading and writing rPath-generated XML
files.

Note that until version 1.0 is released, public APIs are subject to
change.  All documentation regarding stable interfaces is relevant
only to published stable releases; it is not in force for alpha
and beta releases, including 0.x releases and any automated builds.

To use the latest version of the interface:
    from rpath_common import storage
To use a specific API version of the interface:
    from rpath_common.storage import api1 as storage

API documentation is available at http://cvs.rpath.com/rpath-storage-docs/
or by running "make html" and viewing docs/developer/index.html (requires
epydoc).
